         <p> Dear <roleName type="honorific">Consul General:</roleName><lb/>
            <lb/>
         </p>

         <p rend="indent">I understand that <roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName>
            <surname>Thoreson</surname> has written<lb/> to you that it was my fault that <roleName
               type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
            <surname>Bendix</surname> refused to take the<lb/> statue <roleName type="honorific"
               >Miss</roleName>
            <surname>Thoreson</surname> sent to <name type="country">America</name>. She is supposed
            to have<lb/> said that I wanted too <quote>“big a commission"</quote>. There was no
            question<lb/> of a commission, nor did I have anything to do with it(the refu-<lb/>
            sal). The matter was entirely in the hands of <roleName type="honorific">Dr.</roleName>
            <forename type="initials>">J. F. </forename>
            <surname>Lewis</surname>, and<lb/> even if <roleName type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
            <surname>Bendix</surname> had taken the statue I would <emph rend="underline"/> not have received<lb/>
            <emph>ONE CENT OF COMMISSION.</emph><lb/> <lb/>
         </p>
         <p rend="indent">I spent over <num type="ordinal" value="200.00">$200.00</num> of my own
            money trying to<lb/> straighten out the matter and to be accused of trying to get
            com-<lb/> mission under such conditions makes me quite disgusted.<lb/> <lb/> </p>
         <p rend="indent"> Unless <roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName>
            <surname>Thoreson</surname> retracts her statements<lb/> writing to you and sends me
               <emph rend="case: allcaps">A CERTIFIED COPY</emph> something is going to<lb/> happen.
            Unless I have such a certified copy in my hands in <name type="city">Phila-<lb/>
               delphia</name> by <date>July 1st next</date>, I shall order <roleName
               type="honorific">Miss</roleName>
            <surname>Thoreson</surname> to remove the<lb/> statue from the Museum and unless she
            removes it by <date>August 1st</date> I<lb/> shall have it sent to storage, where she
            will have to pay storage<lb/> at so much a month (about <num type="ordinal"
               value="10.00">$10.00</num> monthly).<lb/> <lb/> </p>
         <p rend="indent"> I have had some hope of selling it through a<lb/> friend of mine (whom
            you know), but I shall now drop all negotiat-<lb/> ions. <lb/> </p>
         <p rend="indent"> If and when she sends you the letter of re-<lb/> traction I am sure you
            will out of fairness give it the same<lb/> publicity as you gave the original
            statement.<lb/> <lb/> </p>
         <p rend="indent"> I am sorry I found no opportunity of seeing you<lb/> again before I
            leave, but I am on my way to <name type="city">Gothenburg</name> tomorrow<lb/> and there
            are so many things I must do before I leave.<lb/> <lb/> </p>
         <closer rend="text-align: center"> With very best wishes and greetings I remain,<lb/> <lb/>
            <salute> Sincerely yours,<lb/><lb/>
