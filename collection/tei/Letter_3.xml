            <p rend="text-align: left"> Dear <roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> von
                <surname>Schulzenheim!</surname><lb/> <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I was ill for nearly two weeks lest month, which has made it very difficult<lb/> for
                me to look after matters here, as they piled up in every direction during<lb/> my
                indisposition.<lb/><lb/></p>
            <p>I made a special trip out to <placeName>Chicago</placeName> and <placeName>the
                    west</placeName> in reference to the pieces<lb/> of sculpture when I found that
                    <roleName type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Bendix</surname> did <sic>no</sic> take them and I even went as<lb/> far as
                    <placeName>Kewanee</placeName> to try to persuade <roleName type="honorific"
                    >Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Waller</surname> to take one or both of the pieces,<lb/> but I had no
                success. I have now written to <roleName type="honorific"><sic>M.</sic></roleName>
                <surname>Bendix</surname>, making the situation<lb/> clear to him and asking him to
                reconsider his decision, but I have heard<lb/> nothing so far, and I have today
                written his secretary asking for an early<lb/> reply. When I hear something definite
                I will let you know immediately.<lb/><lb/></p>
            <p>When I first reported the sale of <name><sic><emph rend="underline">Kings of
                            the</emph></sic> Air</name> by <roleName type="honorific"
                    >Miss</roleName>
                <surname>Thoresen</surname>, she was<lb/> apparently pleased and said nothing about
                not being allowed to sell that<lb/> particular copy. I therefore, when I heard from
                her that she would accept<lb/>
                <num type="ordinal" value="2000.00">$ 2000.00</num>, had the piece boxed and sent to
                    <roleName type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Bendix</surname>, and if she has sent him<lb/> a second copy that
                transaction must be between him and her. Such a mixup is,<lb/> to say the least,
                annoying. I have had some trouble with the prices also, as<lb/> you know, since you
                had - in some cases - written one price on the label<lb/> placed on the works of art
                and another price in our catalogue, but I think we<lb/> have that straightened that
                out now.<lb/><lb/></p>
            <p>The stringent financial conditions and the depression here still continue,<lb/> and
                are very much worse than you people in <placeName>Sweden</placeName> have any idea
                of or realize,<lb/> and in some instances they are getting worse instead of better.
                    <roleName>Count</roleName>
                <surname>Berna-<lb/> dotte</surname> and <roleName>Baron</roleName>
                <surname>Langenskjöld</surname> have just completed a trip through American<lb/>
                factories and <roleName>Baron</roleName>
                <surname>Langenskjöld</surname> told me yesterday that in his opinion times<lb/>
                here would be still worse than they are today. The newspapers are telling a<lb/>
                different story to keep up the courage and morale of the nation. It has<lb/> been
                absolutely impossible to raise sufficient money here to put on a big<lb/>
                celebration in connection with the dedication of the John Morton Building, and<lb/>
                the committee has once again come to the conclusion that that we cannot have the
                dedi-<lb/> cation until perhaps in the fall. I am absolutely frantic about it,
                but<lb/> nothing can be done. <roleName>Dr.</roleName>
                <surname>Lewis</surname> and I are working on some way of opening<lb/> the Exhibit
                independently of the dedication and making plans for some kind of<lb/> publicity
                campaign, but this is also going to be difficult. <orgName>The Academy of<lb/> Fine
                    Arts</orgName> has never had such an unsuccessful season in their 128 years
                of<lb/> existence. During their winter exhibition they did not sell a single
                piece,<lb/> which is an unheard of situation in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.
                It is best, therefore, not<lb/> to make any definite arrangements for coming here
                until I can give you the<lb/> complete plan.<lb/><lb/></p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p><lb/>I have been corresponding with the <orgName>Brooklyn Museum of Fine arts</orgName> as
                well as<lb/> other institutions, asking them to take on the exhibit from here.
                    <roleName>The<lb/> Director</roleName> of <orgName>the Brooklyn Museum</orgName>
                came here personally and inspected the works,<lb/> pronouncing them fine indeed.
                However, he could promise to take only a<lb/> portion of the exhibition on account
                of limited space, and as I could not tell<lb/> him whether or not you would agree to
                this, we have nothing definite with<lb/> them.<lb/><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It has been suggested to me that perhaps a better plan would be to bring the<lb/>
                exhibit to the smaller cities, like <placeName>Wilmington, Del.</placeName>,
                    <placeName>Trenton, New Jersey</placeName>,<lb/> and so on, with better success.
                    <roleName type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Pearson</surname>, the <roleName>manager</roleName> of the
                    <orgName>Pearson<lb/> Galleries</orgName> in <placeName>New York</placeName>,
                told me that he had an exhibition recently at which not<lb/> a single thing was
                sold, but that he put on smaller exhibits in other towns<lb/> of the state and thus
                managed to get rid of quite a few sculptures<lb/> which he could not sell in
                <placeName>New York City</placeName>.<lb/><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is terribly unfortunate that your exhibit should be caught in this gene-<lb/> ral
                world depression, but we are helpless in the matter and I do not know<lb/> what to
                do. I have managed to pay the expenses, the transportation from<lb/>
                <placeName>New York</placeName>, custom charges, insurance, etc., which were
                exceedingly heavy.<lb/> We have had a large number of visitors at the Building, who
                have been much<lb/> interested in the exhibit, and I have tried to sell some of the
                works, but<lb/> with little success.<lb/><lb/>

            <p><roleName>Consul</roleName>
                <surname>von Dardel</surname> is no longer in <placeName>Chicago</placeName>, but
                was removed to <placeName>Java</placeName>. It also<lb/> appears that <roleName
                    type="honorific">Miss</roleName>
                <surname>Thoresen</surname> has written to <roleName type="honorific">Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Lincoln</surname> in <placeName>Chicago</placeName>, and I<lb/> have also
                learned that she intends to submit the matter to <orgName>the Foreign<lb/>
                    Department</orgName> to press it through <roleName>the Swedish
                    Minister</roleName> at <placeName>Washington</placeName>. This<lb/> will do no
                good whatsoever, and will only serve to antagonize <roleName type="honorific"
                    >Mr.</roleName>
                <surname>Bendix</surname><lb/> and complicate matters still further.<lb/> <lb/>
