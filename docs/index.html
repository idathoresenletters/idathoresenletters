                     <p>
                        Ida Caroline Thoresen (1863-1937) was a Swedish artist most known for her many figurative, life-size sculptures. Thoresen was born in Gothenburg in a family with a considerat fortune which enabled her to travel around Europe and study art at Académie Julianat in Paris. During her active years, Thoresen accomplished close to a hundred sculptures, some of which are now shown at an exhibition at the National Museum (March 17 - September 11, 2022) about forgotten Swedish female artists.</p>

<p>The image to the left shows a small model of the Sun Worshiper (Soldyrkaren), which is one of Thoresen’s most well-known works. The original is made from Italian marble, measures 244 cm in height, 56 cm in width and 63.5 cm in depth, and was exhibited for the first time in 1897. This sculpture, and the events and dealings around it, is the main topic in the letters that are published here.</p> 

<p>In connection to the opening of  the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, in 1930, a number of Swedish artists contributed works to an exhibition there. The Sun Worshiper was not intended to be part of that exhibition, but was shipped along with other items, to be sold in America by the director of the museum at the time, Amandus Johnson. However, the art market was severely struck by the great depression, and it turned out to be very difficult to sell any art at the time; while Thoreson, in turn, was also affected by economic hardship. At one point the sculpture was to be sold to a Mr Bendix in Chicago. This agreement remained for a while, but it seems that Bendix went back on his word to buy the sculpture and Thoresen was left with a large loan that she needed to repay in Sweden. This is the situation in which the greater part of this correspondence takes place.</p>

<p>Thoresen never received the funds and the sculpture remained in Philadelphia. After Thoresen’s death, it somehow came into the possession of Thoresen’s partner Elisabeth Barnekow who wrote to Mr Johnson sometime between 1937-1938 and donated the sculpture to the museum. Today the Sun Worshiper is taken off display and is placed in curatorial storage.</p>

<p>The letters that are presented here have been in Thoresen’s possession, and most of them address her. During our work digitizing them, we have been in contact with the current director of the American Swedish Historical Museum, and have been assured to receive scans of a number of letters from Ida Thoresen that are in their possession. However, these have not arrived in time to be published here.</p>

<p>These letters were digitized in the spring semester of 2022 as a part of the course Digitizing Cultural Heritage Materials at Bosås University.</p>
