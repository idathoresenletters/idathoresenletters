                      <br>
                      <u>Philadelphia.</u> <br>
                     Pennsylvania
                     
                     
                     </p>

                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                     My dear Dr. Johnson,<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Your letter of the 16th of May came to hand as I re-<br>
                     turned from a few days trip south and I am very sorry, indeed<br>
                     that I had no chance to meet you again and to continue the<br>
                     pleasant discussion we had when you were kind enough to visit<br>
                     me in my office.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> I am also sorry that we did not meet se that I could<br>
                     clear up the misunderstanding, on which your letter to me<br>
                     seems to be based. I tried to get hold of you over the te-<br>
                     lephone both in Stockholm and Gothenburg, 
                     but did not succeed.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Before I had an opportunity to write my answer I re-<br>
                     ceived a call from Miss 
                     Thoresen. <u>I may mention that this<br>
                        was the first time I ever saw Miss 
                        Thoresen or had any kind of<br>
                        communication with her in the above matter.</u> This very charming<br>
                     lady was rather upset about your letter to me, of which you<br>
                     have sent her a copy. Since she had not done, what you seem<br>
                     to think she had, she was not afraid of your threats but very<br>
                     sorry, that you should suspect her. She told me, that she had<br>
                     never even had a thought, that you had tried to hold up the<br>
                     sale of her statue. On the contrary, she felt, that you had<br>
                     been very kind to her and done all that was possible to be of<br>
                     assistance to her, even if she was sorry, that you had not<br>
                     accepted the cheque from Mr. 
                     Bendix in the first place.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> As for my part, I do not understand, why you got me<br>
                     mixed up in this matter. I have had nothing to do with it<br>
                     from beginning to end, received no letter from 
                     Miss Thoresen<br>
                     or anybody else about it and taken no action of any kind. It<br>
                     would be rather interesting to know, who could be the mischief<br>
                     maker, who has been telling you differently.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> I do not see, why things of this kind have to come<br>
                     up between you and me. As you are aware, I have sometimes<br>
                     differred with you in my ideas - and always plainly told you<br>
                     so - but I have never doubted the disihterested zeal, with<br> <br>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px;">2.  Dr.
                     Amandus Johnson.</p> <br>
                  
                  
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                     which you have pursued whatever cause you have thought right<br>
                     and I have always been under the impression, that this respect<br>
                     for you has been reciprocated.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Instead of writing a letter like that, would it not<br>
                     have not been a good idea to get in touch with me or with 
                     Miss<br>
                     Thoresen, which would have cleared up the matter without this<br>
                     unnecessary correspondence. Incidentally would it not be<br>
                     wise not to believe everything that is told to you, when it<br>
                     must seem unreasonable, that it is true.<br> <br></p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> I hope, that if there is anything I can do to assist<br>
                     you in the work, which we were discussing in our meeting here,<br>
                     you will let me know,<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> In the meantime I remain, with kindest regards and <br>
                     best greetings,<br> <br>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        Very sincerely yours.<br>
