                     </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Dear Consul General:<br>
                     <br>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;">I understand that Miss
                     Thoreson has written<br> to you that it was my fault that Mr.
                     Bendix refused to take the<br> statue Miss
                     Thoreson sent to America. She is supposed
                     to have<br> said that I wanted too “big a commission". There was no
                     question<br> of a commission, nor did I have anything to do with it(the refu-<br>
                     sal). The matter was entirely in the hands of Dr.
                     J. F. 
                     Lewis, and<br> even if Mr.
                     Bendix had taken the statue I would <u></u> not have received<br>
                     <br> <br>
                     </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;">I spent over $200.00 of my own
                     money trying to<br> straighten out the matter and to be accused of trying to get
                     com-<br> mission under such conditions makes me quite disgusted.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Unless Miss
                     Thoreson retracts her statements<br> writing to you and sends me
                      something is going to<br> happen.
                     Unless I have such a certified copy in my hands in Phila-<br>
                     delphia by July 1st next, I shall order Miss
                     Thoreson to remove the<br> statue from the Museum and unless she
                     removes it by August 1st I<br> shall have it sent to storage, where she
                     will have to pay storage<br> at so much a month (about $10.00 monthly).<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> I have had some hope of selling it through a<br> friend of mine (whom
                     you know), but I shall now drop all negotiat-<br> ions. <br> </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> If and when she sends you the letter of re-<br> traction I am sure you
                     will out of fairness give it the same<br> publicity as you gave the original
                     statement.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> I am sorry I found no opportunity of seeing you<br> again before I
                     leave, but I am on my way to Gothenburg tomorrow<br> and there
                     are so many things I must do before I leave.<br> <br> </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px;"> With very best wishes and greetings I remain,<br> <br>
                      Sincerely yours,<br><br>

                  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;">Copy to Miss
                     Thoreson and Minister
                     Boström.<br> From the enclosed statement from my former secretary
                     you will see<br> how the matter really stood. I shall have a certified statement
                     f<br> her when I return to America, which will prove
                     that the above state-<br> ments are correct and that I had nothing to do with the
                     refusal of<br>
                     Mr.
                     Bendix Please return the statement of my secretary, as I want<br>
                     to send it to Minister
                     Boström.<br>
