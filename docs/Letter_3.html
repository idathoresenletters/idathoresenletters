                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Dear Miss von
                        Schulzenheim!<br> <br>
                        </p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I was ill for nearly two weeks lest month, which has made it very difficult<br> for
                        me to look after matters here, as they piled up in every direction during<br> my
                        indisposition.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I made a special trip out to Chicago and the
                        west in reference to the pieces<br> of sculpture when I found that
                        Mr.
                        Bendix did no take them and I even went as<br> far as
                        Kewanee to try to persuade Mr.
                        Waller to take one or both of the pieces,<br> but I had no
                        success. I have now written to M.
                        Bendix, making the situation<br> clear to him and asking him to
                        reconsider his decision, but I have heard<br> nothing so far, and I have today
                        written his secretary asking for an early<br> reply. When I hear something definite
                        I will let you know immediately.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">When I first reported the sale of <u>Kings of
                           the</u> Air by Miss
                        Thoresen, she was<br> apparently pleased and said nothing about
                        not being allowed to sell that<br> particular copy. I therefore, when I heard from
                        her that she would accept<br>
                        $ 2000.00, had the piece boxed and sent to
                        Mr.
                        Bendix, and if she has sent him<br> a second copy that
                        transaction must be between him and her. Such a mixup is,<br> to say the least,
                        annoying. I have had some trouble with the prices also, as<br> you know, since you
                        had - in some cases - written one price on the label<br> placed on the works of art
                        and another price in our catalogue, but I think we<br> have that straightened that
                        out now.<br><br></p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The stringent financial conditions and the depression here still continue,<br> and
                        are very much worse than you people in Sweden have any idea
                        of or realize,<br> and in some instances they are getting worse instead of better.
                        Count
                        Berna-<br> dotte and Baron
                        Langenskjöld have just completed a trip through American<br>
                        factories and Baron
                        Langenskjöld told me yesterday that in his opinion times<br>
                        here would be still worse than they are today. The newspapers are telling a<br>
                        different story to keep up the courage and morale of the nation. It has<br> been
                        absolutely impossible to raise sufficient money here to put on a big<br>
                        celebration in connection with the dedication of the John Morton Building, and<br>
                        the committee has once again come to the conclusion that that we cannot have the
                        dedi-<br> cation until perhaps in the fall. I am absolutely frantic about it,
                        but<br> nothing can be done. Dr.
                        Lewis and I are working on some way of opening<br> the Exhibit
                        independently of the dedication and making plans for some kind of<br> publicity
                        campaign, but this is also going to be difficult. The Academy of<br> Fine
                        Arts has never had such an unsuccessful season in their 128 years
                        of<br> existence. During their winter exhibition they did not sell a single
                        piece,<br> which is an unheard of situation in Philadelphia.
                        It is best, therefore, not<br> to make any definite arrangements for coming here
                        until I can give you the<br> complete plan.<br><br></p>
                     
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br>I have been corresponding with the Brooklyn Museum of Fine arts as
                        well as<br> other institutions, asking them to take on the exhibit from here.
                        The<br> Director of the Brooklyn Museum
                        came here personally and inspected the works,<br> pronouncing them fine indeed.
                        However, he could promise to take only a<br> portion of the exhibition on account
                        of limited space, and as I could not tell<br> him whether or not you would agree to
                        this, we have nothing definite with<br> them.<br><br>
                        </p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">It has been suggested to me that perhaps a better plan would be to bring the<br>
                        exhibit to the smaller cities, like Wilmington, Del.,
                        Trenton, New Jersey,<br> and so on, with better success.
                        Mr.
                        Pearson, the manager of the
                        Pearson<br> Galleries in New York,
                        told me that he had an exhibition recently at which not<br> a single thing was
                        sold, but that he put on smaller exhibits in other towns<br> of the state and thus
                        managed to get rid of quite a few sculptures<br> which he could not sell in
                        New York City.<br><br>
                        </p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">It is terribly unfortunate that your exhibit should be caught in this gene-<br> ral
                        world depression, but we are helpless in the matter and I do not know<br> what to
                        do. I have managed to pay the expenses, the transportation from<br>
                        New York, custom charges, insurance, etc., which were
                        exceedingly heavy.<br> We have had a large number of visitors at the Building, who
                        have been much<br> interested in the exhibit, and I have tried to sell some of the
                        works, but<br> with little success.<br><br>
                        </p>
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Consul
                        von Dardel is no longer in Chicago, but
                        was removed to Java. It also<br> appears that Miss
                        Thoresen has written to Mr.
                        Lincoln in Chicago, and I<br> have also
                        learned that she intends to submit the matter to the Foreign<br>
                        Department to press it through the Swedish
                        Minister at Washington. This<br> will do no
                        good whatsoever, and will only serve to antagonize Mr.
                        Bendix<br> and complicate matters still further.<br> <br>
                        </p>
                     
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Regretting that the conditions are so unfortunate, I am<br>
