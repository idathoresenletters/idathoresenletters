                     78 Riddaregatan
                     <br>
                     Stockholm,
                     Sweden.
                     <br>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Dear Miss von
                        Schulzenheim:<br> </p>
                     
                     <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> We have made considerable progress with the
                        arrangements of the<br> exhibit. Last night men from the Academy of Fine
                        Arts worked here until<br> past ten o’clock and they are here this
                        morning. I think they shall<br> finish hanging the pictures tomorrow. We have not
                        followed your arrange-<br> ment at all, as the President of
                        the Academy of Fine Arts thought we<br> should place them in
                        a manner that would suit American taste and be more<br> effective in displaying the
                        pictures. The paintings alone fill up nine<br> rooms, as we have given them plenty
                        of space. We have not as yet put up<br> the sculptures and the other things. I
                        believe we shall not arrange the<br> textiles or the embroidery work, as that might
                        fade in the sun, and I do<br> not believe that we should sell them this summer.
                        Likewise, I believe we<br> shall keep the small things packed in boxes until the
                        fall. It will be too<br> difficult to look after the little things when visitors
                        come here. The<br> collection is insured against all risks, fire, theft, etc.</p>
                     
                     <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;">It seems that someone has made inquiries in New York about
                        the con-<br> dition of the exhibit and what precautions have been taken against
                        risks<br> etc. I did not tell the Academy of Fine Arts about
                        this, for if they knew<br> about those inquiries they would probably not care to
                        have anything further<br> to do with the exhibit. I would, however, advise you very
                        strongly, not<br> to make inquiries from any other parties about this exhibit, if
                        you want<br> us to handle it.</p> 
                     <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;">I am sending you a cable today, asking you to
                        come over on the 14th<br> if you can, to be with us on the
                        24th, when we have a sort of private<br> opening. You could stay a
                        week and then go back on a Swedish boat. I<br> should like this very much, as we
                        then could talk matters over concerning<br> prices and other points which are not
                        very clear to us. We shall not<br> print the catalogue until the fall, but use a
                        manuscript copy in the<br> sale of the Art. We have made no further effort to sell
                        any more of<br> your paintings and pieces of sculpture and will not until I hear by
                        letter<br> from you. However, we have had a number of inquiries. For instance,
                        I<br> have a party who wants to buy "The Windmill" by
                        Akerman, and the Landscape<br> in Scania; but
                        they have offered only $150.00 for
                        "The Windmill" and<br>
                        $175.00 for the Landscape. I
                        could not sell it for that as I do not know<br> if the artist would accept that
                        price, especially since the Academy of<br> Fine Arts wants 15 %.
                        If however, the artist is willing to accept those<br> prices, and we cannot get the
                        price given in the catalogue, we shall sell<br> it to the party in question. Do not
                        cable the artist’s decision on this<br> as there is time enough to write. I have
                        the name and the address of the<br> party and can always get in touch with her. It
                        is quite possible that<br> we get an offer for the full price that this lady will
                        pay the price you<br> have intimated, although she said she would not.</p> 
                     <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> On
                        account of these conditions, it would be very desirable if you<br> could come here
                        for about a week or two weeks. We could then have the<br> exhibit in fine shape in
                        the fall. However, I am myself going to Stockholm<br> this
                        summer and hope to be there towards the end of July unless my Doctors<br> should
                        forbid me to travel. Unfortunately I must go to the hospital tomorrow<br> or the
                        next day for observation, as they do not seem to know what is the<br> trouble with
                        me. They assure me, however, that I shall be out in about a<br> week or at the most
                        two weeks and will be on my feet by the time we have our<br> annual meeting and
                        private opening.<br>
                        </p>
                     
                     <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Hoping that it may be possible for you to come here and with very best<br>
                        wishes to you and your Society, I remain,<br>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Very sincerely yours, </p>

                     <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        P.S. I am sorry you did not send the original manuscript with
                        your English<br> translation as we fail to understand what you mean by your
                        phraseology in<br> one or two cases, for instance you say “wastecloset", so far
                        as I know there<br> is no such word in English and there could not be one. Do
                        you mean "Skräp-<br> rum" or
                        "skräpkammare"? In any event we could not use
                        "wastecloset"-- that<br> means nothing. Your translation of
                        “Handarbetets Vänner" is also
                        inaccurate<br> and a great many other terms will not do. However, I shall
                        revise the Eng-<br> lish but I wish you would send the original Swedish in case
                        you send any<br> other manuscripts. I am anxiously waiting for the ten pages of
                        History of<br> Swedish Art which will make the catalogue valuable and make it
                        easy to sell.<br> Beside I can find no portrait of the Crown Princess nor or
                        the other prin-<br> ces. </p>
